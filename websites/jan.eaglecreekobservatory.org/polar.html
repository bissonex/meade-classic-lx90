<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Polar
Aligning a Meade LX90</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Polar alignment is a necessary setup procedure
when using your LX90 for imaging. It also has the advantage of
only driving the RA axis. When setup properly it will give you
long views through your EP without having to adjust for drift of
the object. I strongly suggest the use of three carriage bolts to
secure the wedge to the tripod, and not just using the 1/2&quot;
bolt supplied with your tripod. This is safer, and it makes for a
more stable mount. Make sure you use stainless steel bolts, as
other metals could interfere with your compass' accuracy.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Preliminary setup </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">The first and most important thing you need to
do is level your tripod, and set it up in the proper orientation
to the celestial pole. If at all possible, select a location
where Polaris is visble. The image below shows my LX90 in polar
&quot;home&quot; position. You should be able to look through the
finder and see Polaris (once it's dark enough)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="polarhome.jpg" width="360" height="480"></font></p>

<p><font size="2">That single leg that the wedge hangs over
should be pointed due south. Use the compass on the wedge to
setup your tripod prior to attaching the LX90. Once on the wedge,
the LX90 makes it hard to move the tripod - so setup the tripod
first. Definately get assistance if this is required, or
alternatively remove the scope from the wedge and start over,
noting the amount of rotation needed for the tripod.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Tripod Setup - or, how
level is level and which way is North?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">To begin, orient the tripod so that the &quot;south&quot;
leg is somewhat southerly. Adjust the wedge compass in it's
holder so that the &quot;white&quot; arrow is pointing straight
towards the level on the tripod head. If you've setup your
compass (</font><a href="http://www.meade.com/manuals/lx200/apxa.html#apxa4a"><font size="2">Meade's method</font></a><font size="2">) or (</font><a href="compass.html"><font size="2">my
method</font></a><font size="2">) for your local magnetic
declination, the 'N&quot; indicator will be slightly off to one
side or the other of the arrow. Magnetic declination changes over
time, so I wouldn't use Meade's chart, </font><a href="http://www.geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/geomag/e_cgrf.html"><font size="2">use this link instead</font></a><font size="2">. The
instructions in the next paragraph refer to the way I setup my
compass, not Meade's method. For Meade's instructions, follow the
link above.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Move the tripod until the compass needle points
to &quot;N&quot;, not to the arrow. The closer you are to &quot;true&quot;
north (not magnetic north) the better off you'll be. Your azimuth
adjuster only travels so far, so if you're quite a few degrees
off from true north, you may have to relocate the tripod to make
up the difference. This is not an easy task with a polar mounted
LX90. I can lift and carry my LX90/tripod a pretty good distance
in alt/az, but the wedge makes the whole setup very cumbersome.
The center of gravity is much higher and off center, making it a
chore to move after setting up. A side note here - I took a piece
of white paper and cut it to fit under the compass, this makes
the graduations stand out much more clearly, so that it's easier
to read in the dark.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Once you have the tripod leveled, ( I use a 9&quot;
torpedo level - the supplied level on my tripod was quite
unreliable) put all your weight on the tripod to &quot;set&quot;
the legs, and check the level again. Once you're happy the tripod
is properly aligned, level and set, lift the LX90 up and hang it
on the wedge, and then attach the remaining bolts to secure it.
Plug in your power and Autostar, and any accessories you may be
using. Adjust your weights and balance the scope.</font></p>

        wedge and replaced it with a larger, more accurate level.
        The level can be removed from the wedge and reset (If
        your's is as bad as mine was, you may want to do this). I
        used a small block of wood and a hammer to tap the level
        just hard enough to break it's adhesive mount. Once you
        can remove the level you can re-attach it with a small
        amount of silicone adhesive. Level the tripod/wedge with
        a good torpedo level, then put enough adhesive in the
        hole to hold the level in place. Place the level back in
        the hole, adjusting it so that the bubble is centered.
        Recheck the level of the tripod/wedge and make sure your
        bubble is centered. Wait at leaset 24 hours for the
        silicone to cure. A nice little project to undertake when
        you're under cloudy skies for a few days. If you want to
        use a replacement level, the same instructions would
        apply. Replacement levels can be purchased at most
        hardware stores and from</font><font color="#400040" size="2"> </font><a href="http://www.mcmaster.com"><font color="#400040" size="2">McMaster-Carr</font></a><font color="#400040" size="2">.</font><p align="center"><font color="#400040" size="2"><img src="tripodlevel.jpg" border="1" width="261" height="198"><br>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Wedge Setup - or,
what's latitude got to do with it?</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Your wedge should be setup on
the tripod head so that the tilt plate is facing North (Polaris).
The latitude adjuster should be facing south. If you've installed
the wedge properly, this should be obvious after setting up the
tripod in the previous section. If you install your wedge after
the tripod is setup (I leave my wedge attached to the tripod),
you need to orient it properly. On the standard Meade wedge, the
azimuth adjuster is on the North side of the tripod head. Your
lattitude adjuster should be set initially to your respective
lattitude by the scale on the side of the wedge. These scales are
not etched or engraved, so accuracy should be obtained by using
Polaris/NCP to set the tilt plate. Don't rely on the scale for
accuracy. Make sure your azimuth adjuster is &quot;centered&quot;
before beginning alignment, so you have free travel in both
directions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The latitude adjuster aligns (makes
perpendicular) the tilt plate with the polar axis - in turn
setting the RA axis parallel to the Earth's polar axis, the
azimuth adjuster is used to correct for true north adjustments.
Note the difference in the tilt plates between &quot;near equator&quot;
and &quot;near pole&quot;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400040" size="2"><img src="polar2.jpg" width="500" height="500"></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Polar Home - getting
ready for power up</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Polar home is a strange position, you may feel
at first that it's incorrect. The scope should have the handles
&quot;up&quot; ( the finder on top of the OTA) and the OTA should
be parallel to the forks. Very few of us with LX90's actually use
the RA and Dec scales, but if you wish to reset them, now would
be the time. Take some extra time here to be sure the OTA is as
parallel to the forks as possible. I've found this to be the main
reason to cause poor tracking and GoTo's.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Once that's done, I use the torpedo level again
to insure the centerline between the two forks is parallel to the
ground. I set the level so that the ends are supported by the
fork handles, and the center is laid flat on the battery
compartment. If you have a longer level, you can slip it through
the fork handles instead. Loosen the RA lock and rotate the scope
on the RA axis until the forks are level as shown below. You're
now in Polar &quot;home&quot; position.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><img src="level1.jpg" width="524" height="269"><br>
</font><font size="1">A 9&quot; torpedo level set flat on the
battery compartment and resting on the fork arms. Rotate the RA
axis until the forks are level.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="1"><img src="level2.jpg" width="245" height="353"><br>
Ends of the level resting on the fork arms</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you're at a location where Polaris can't be
seen, you can move on to initial alignment with the Autostar. If
you can see Polaris from your location, use the wedge latitude
and azimuth adjusters to center Polaris in your EP, or use a
reticle EP if you have one. Polaris is *not* at the exact north
celestial pole, so it need not be perfect. With Polaris centered
in your EP, you're now only about 1/2 a degree from polar
alignment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong>Autostar Alignment -
ready to observe and the final tweaks for a perfect polar
alignment</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are three Autostar alignment methods for
Polar mode - Easy, One star, and Two star. If you're just out for
a visual observing session, Easy is the fastest. If you have
limited view of the sky, you may want to select Two star, in
which case you can select your own alignment stars from what's
visible to you. In either method, alignment is the same as in Alt-Az
mode - the Autostar will slew the scope to an alignment star, ask
you to center it, and move on to the next.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One star alignment is a different beast. If you
select one star, the scope will rotate about its RA axis, and
just slightly in declination, and then ask you to center Polaris
in the EP - not by using the Autostar controls like the previous
methods, but by using the wedge adjusters. This method gives you
a much more precise alignment to the celestial pole. You're
actually adjusting the wedge at this point to the pole - not to
Polaris as described previously. Once you center Polaris by using
the wedge, the Autostar will slew to it's single star for
alignment. Center the star in the EP, and hit Enter to continue
on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">At this point you can start observing, or if
you plan on doing some imaging, you may want to start checking
and fine tuning your polar alignment by the </font><a href="/drift.html"><font size="2">drift
method</font></a><font size="2">. Another excellent method for
Polar alignment is using Dr. P Clay Sherrod's </font><a href="http://www.weasner.com/etx/ref_guides/polar_align.html"><font size="2">&quot;Kochab's Clock&quot;</font></a><font size="2">.
This is quick and accurate as well, especially after you've
practiced it a few times. You should be familiar with the stars
of Ursa Minor and know your finderscope's FOV.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">If you're having a hard time visualizing drift
alignment, and how or why stars &quot;drift&quot; in an unaligned
scope, visit Bruce Johnston's excellent page on drift alignment.
All you ever wanted to know about drift alignment, with excellent
diagrams and explainations. Bruce's page is located here - </font><a href="http://www.mapug-astronomy.net/ccdastro/drift-align.htm"><font size="2">drift-align</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2">All in all, Polar alignment is a bit more
tedious than Alt-Az, but the benefits far outweigh the extra
setup time involved. After you've done it a few times, setup time
is not that much more than required in Alt-Az mode. Because of
the portability and quick setup time with an LX90, I can pack it
in the car and be at a decent dark site within a half an hour.</font></p>
