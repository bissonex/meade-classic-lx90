      </center>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">The LX90 base is not
normally disassembled for access. General adjustments to the
worm, degreasing and cleaning, and re-greasing can all be done
through the inspection/access cover. It's unnecessary to
disassemble the entire base except for the following reasons.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"><em>1) The RA drive PCB has
failed, and must be replaced.<br>
2) The spur gear, worm or motor is damaged and must be replaced<br>
3) The RA casting is broken and must be be replaced (some
disassembly)<br>
4) The tripod adapter has stripped or cracked, and needs
replacement.<br>
5) Either the upper or lower bearing needs replacement<br>
6) It's time for a complete cleaning and inspection of the drive
components</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Before starting work:<br>
1) Remove batteries<br>
2) Have needle nose pliers, and .05&quot;, 5/32&quot;, 3/32&quot;
and 1/16&quot; allen wrenches handy<br>
3) Have cleaning rags and fresh white lithium grease<br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">During the disassembly process,
check each part as you remove it and degrease it. Looks for
cracks, stripped threads, loose screws or other signs of wear.
Make sure the bearings aren't beginning to fail. Make sure the
races are tight and not cracked or galled, and that the seals are
in place, and grease or oil isn't leaking out from under the
seals.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Check the wiring for cracks or
missing insulation. Make sure they aren't touching any moving
surfaces, or being pinched between parts. Make sure the
connectors are tight and make a good connection.</font></p>

      </center>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Degreasing can be done by
removing the three .05&quot; allen screws from the access cover
on the bottom. The last screw can remain in place since it has a
slotted hole on the cover.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Once removed, support the
telescope OTA and disengage the RA lock. You can now rotate the
base around to see different parts of the components inside. You
can degrease the inside diameter of the spur gear, and in a
similar fashion to the</font><a href="dec.html"><font color="#000000" size="2"> instructions here</font></a><font color="#000000" size="2"> for the worm gear. There really is no
need to go beyond this point for general inspections and
degreasing of the worm and spur gear.</font></p>

</font><font color="#000000" size="2">Removing the tripod adapter
from the base</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">The Tripod Adapter
is removed by first removing the three allen screws securing it,
with a 3/32&quot; allen wrench. The next step is to lock the RA
Lock (clockwise) and insert the 1/2x13 threaded rod into the
adapter. Thread the rod in until pressure is felt. Then, very
gently, tighten the rod a little at a time until the adapter
breaks free from the interior of the lower RA shaft. Pull the
adapter out while still attached to the rod, remove it from the 1/2x13
rod and set it aside with the three allen screws previously
removed.</font></p>

Removing the RA casting </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">The next part to
be removed is the RA casting. If your casting has broken, follow
the instructions that came with the new casting, especially those referring to the washers on the 1/2x13 bolt below the spreader. If
your bolt can be seen above the tripod adapter when attached to
the tripod, you need to add washers so that the casting doesn't
break again.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Unscrew the RA
locking bolt until the RA casting drops through the bottom of the
base. Set it aside with the other parts. If you're replacing the
casting, the broken piece is still attached to the RA bolt, which
we'll remove next.</font></p>

The main removable components of the base.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">On the side of the
RA knob is a set screw that needs to be loosened before the knob
can be removed. Loosen this set screw, then grab the other end of
the bolt gently (through the base, now open) with a pair a needle
nose pliers, and unthread the knob from the bolt. If you have
problems here, unscrew the set screw even farther, or remove it
completely. Just don't lose it. When reassembling this knob, be
sure the set screw is located above the flat on the bolt before
tightening. Once the knob is removed, you can drop the bolt
through the bottom of the base. Degrease and re-thread the knob
back on the bolt to keep them together.</font></p>

the battery cover and battery holders</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">The battery
holders must be removed at this point. Remove the covers and set
aside. Pull out the white holders and unclamp the black
connectors and pull them apart. Set the two battery holders aside.
Inside each battery compartment are two 3/32&quot; allen head
screws, one on each side of the compartment at the top. Remove
these four screws (two in each compartment) and set aside.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Once the screws
are removed, you can lift the top of the battery compartment (black
plastic) away from the actual casting. You can pull the red/black
battery wires through the holes if you wish, or just set the
whole cover slightly aside. There's no need to completely remove
the cover, you just want access to what's underneath it. What's
underneath is the part that holds both halves together, shown
below.</font></p>

the Bottom half of the base from the Top</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Under the battery
cover is a spanner type plug/flange that threads into the hollow
RA shaft. If you plan to remove the worm, motor, bearings,
circuit board or spur gear, this has to be removed. You can use
an adjustable spanner, or your needle nose pliers. This flange
has a spring steel tensioner (to prevent unscrewing in use), so
it's best to unscrew the base from the flange, rather than
unscrew the flange from the base. Grip the two holes in the plug/flange
with your pliers or spanner, and start unscrewing the base from
the top halve. The threads are pretty fine inside the RA shaft,
so it will take a little while to fully unthread this flange from
the RA shaft. You'll see the gap widening at the RA scale as you
unscrew the base. </font></p>

degreasing, you can remove and clean / re-grease. Make sure you
have enough grease on the RA shaft.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">At this point, the Drive PCB
can be replaced. Make a drawing of the connectors before removing
the old PCB and installing the new one. You can go ahead and
degrease the worm, and check the adjustments in the same fashion
as the </font><a href="dec.html"><font color="#000000" size="2">declination
page</font></a><font color="#000000" size="2">. If the bearing is
being replaced at this point, drive it out from the top with a
brass rod, tapping on the outer race at evenly spaced locations
until it drops out of the casting. Drive the new one in with a
proper sized bearing driver, The same for the upper bearing if
its being replaced. If replacing the worm remove the two pivot
screws, taking note of the shim washer locations, and install the
new worm and motor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">To clean the encoders, the worm
assembly should be removed and cleaned separately. </font><a href="worm.html"><font color="#000000" size="2">Instructions are here</font></a><font color="#000000" size="2"> for the declination worm and gearbox.
The RA assembly is very similar.</font></p>

      <hr color="#0000FF">

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="3"><strong>Reassembly</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Reassembly is
simply the reverse of the above procedures. Note that the
bearings are sealed and do not need lubrication. If the inner
race seems loose, or grease/oil has dripped out of the seals, or
if they're noisy or have tight spots, replace them. I didn't get
the number of the bearing when I took the base apart - I
completely forget to at the time. I will definitely check to see
if it's a stock bearing (It certainly looked like it was). Be
sure you hold the worm back when sliding the base back into the
bearings. Don't over tighten any screws, and if you think they
aren't tightening,. take a break and come back. Take your time
and don't strip any threads. Be very sure that screws and holes
are lined up before forcing the screws in.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Check all cables
and wires as you reassemble to prevent any pinched wires or
unattached plugs.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">The RA plug/flange
can be tightened by holding it with a spanner or needle-nose
pilers, and then tightening the base by turning it clockwise (as
viewed from the bottom). Once the gears are back in, reattach the
battery cover and reinstall the battery holders. Slide the RA
bolt up into the RA shaft (make sure the c-clip is installed on
it) and re-attach the knob. Make sure the flat on the bolt is
aligned with the set screw on the knob, and thread the knob onto
the bolt <em>as far as you can but still align with the flat.
Then tighten up the set screw. </em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">You can now
lubricate the RA casting on the tops of each &quot;foot&quot;
where it will tighten against the spur gear. Grease the threads
at the top where the RA bolt will screw in, and then slide the
casting up into the base, lining it up with the three slots.
Tighten the RA lock until the casting is fully draw up into the
base. Insert the tripod adapter and then tighten each screw a
little at a time before moving to the next. 1/2 turn on each of
these screws before going to the next is almost too much. You
want the tripod adapter to be drawn up into the lower casting as
evenly and as slowly as possible. </font> <em><font color="#FF0000" size="2">Do not over tighten these
screws!</font><font color="#000000" size="2"> </font> </em><font color="#000000" size="2">All three should be snug, but not overly tightened
to the point of possibly stripping the threads or cracking the
casting.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2">Put your batteries
back in, replace the covers, and make sure everything works. At the next opportunity, retrain the
drives. You
should be good for another year or two before needing another
cleaning and re-greasing, depending on your usage and environment. </font></p>

      <hr color="#0000FF">

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FF0000" size="3">How the
whole thing works</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">The RA bolt/knob threads into the
RA casting, not the flange or base. When you tighten the RA bolt,
you effectively &quot;lift&quot; the RA casting up against the RA
gear from below (this is the clutch). It's turns are only limited
by the distance the RA casting has to be drawn up to lock the
gear to the shaft, the amount it protrudes above the flange, and
the distance between it and the tripod bolt (or the wedge adapter
bolt). The RA bolt is held in place by the RA casting and a small
c-clip on the shaft. This c-clip is a &quot;keeper&quot;, it
holds the RA bolt in place, so that it can't be unscrewed and
removed. That's why you can't pull the bolt out through the top
of the base.<br>
<br>
When slewing, the RA gear doesn't turn - it's locked to the RA
shaft. The upper half of the base is driven by the worm &quot;crawling&quot;
around the locked RA gear. The RA knob, bolt, RA casting, lower
base and RA shaft, flange, and RA gear are all tight when locked
and do not move during slews - they're independent of the
components on the upper base (except the worm contacting the RA
gear). When you release the RA clutch, the RA gear is no longer
&quot;locked&quot; to the RA shaft, and the lower base is free
from the upper.</font> T<font size="2">he RA spur gear moves with
the worm and the rest of the upper base components when the RA
lock is released.</font><br>
