<p align="left"><font face="Arial">These adjustments are
basically the same as the LX200 (8&quot;) OTA. Below is a basic
diagram of the focuser assembly.&nbsp; The only modifications
I've done to the focuser is to remove the excess grease from the
threaded rod, bushing and nylon washers, and to attach a &quot;jiffy
focuser&quot; to the knob. </font></p>

        recommend this mod for your focuser. My initial results
        after installation have proven very satisfactory. I'll

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">A &quot;</font><a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/jif/jiffy.html"><font face="Arial">Jiffy focuser</font></a><font face="Arial">&quot; is
a&nbsp; Jiffy peanut butter lid with a hole for the focus knob
and a grommet. This allows for more accurate focusing. I used a
small spice bottle top about 1 3/4&quot; in diameter that was
white. After the backlash adjustment, degreasing and adding the
jiffy, focusing is smooth, light, accurate and a pleasure to use.
The nylon washers&nbsp;can be replaced with with 2 Torrington NTA-815&nbsp;1/2&quot;
thrust bearings&nbsp; and a TRA-815 thrust washer,&nbsp;
resulting in a&nbsp; focuser that almost feels unattached to the
primary mirror and snaps into focus every time. See the focuser
bearing mod link in the update above.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Following is the Meade
recommended adjustment for the focuser</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Mirror Shift</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Elevate the optical tube so that it
is pointing slightly above the horizontal and lock down the
declination lock. Rotate the focus knob counter-clockwise as far
as possible without forcing it. This will put the primary mirror
all the way forward on the baffle tube and extend the focus rod
all the way to the end of its travel. Remove the three hex screws
that mount the focuser assembly to the rear cell of the telescope.
Slowly draw the focuser assembly out of the hole in the rear cell.
You will be drawing the primary mirror back down the baffle tube
as you pull the focuser out. Pull gently until the primary mirror
slider stops against the rear cell.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">At this point, its a good idea to
familiarize yourself with the focuser assembly and how it engages
with the primary mirror mount. The focus rod has a hole in its
end through which a pin from the primary mirror mount passes.
Rotating the focus knob threads the focus rod in and out, pushing
or pulling on the pin, which in turn, moves the primary mirror.
The rod is not fastened to the pin and may detach during this
procedure. If this happens simply slide the threaded rod over the
pin to reinstall.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Gently push and pull the primary mirror up
and down the baffle tube, using the focuser assembly ten to
twelve times. This will even out the lubrication on the baffle
tube and allow for the smoother movement of the primary mirror.
If the travel seems stiffer or more loose in certain areas,
repeat several more time to further even out the lubricant.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Then push the mirror back into the rear
cell, making certain that the pin from the primary mirror mount
is through the hole in the focuser rod. Thread in the three hex
screws to remount the focuser assembly to the rear cell, but do
not tighten. Wiggle the focuser assembly to make sure that the
mounting plate is flush and centered with the opening in the rear
cell and that the holes are centered around the three hex screws
before tightening.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Focuser Backlash</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Now turn the remounted focuser
assembly focus knob all the way clockwise until it stops at the
end of its travel. Release the two hex head set-screws on the
sides of the shiney aluminum focus knob. Continue to turn the
focus knob clockwise until it feels snug (this will remove all of
the backlash in the focuser mechanism).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">With the set-screws still released, turn
the focus knob counter-clockwise about 1/16th of a turn. At this
point you are making an adjustment for the smoothness action of
the focuser. Reset the focuser knob set-screws, first by turning
in one of the set-screws until it just bottoms out. Turn in the
second set-screw tight (if necessary rotate the focus knob a
little so that you can gain access to the second screw), then
tighten the first set-screw. This method will insure that you do
not tighten the focus knob off-center.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Test the focus mechanism to see if the
backlash and/or image shift has been eliminated to a large degree.
It should be recognized that it is impossible to eliminate it
entirely, as it is normal to have some of this effect in this
system due to the fact that the mechanism moves the primary
mirror on a slider that is mounted on the main baffle tube of the
optical tube assembly (a design that allows the greatest range of
focus possible for a variety of accessory attachments). At this
point you may find that you have resolved the problem, or you may
now experience that the focus knob is either too tight, or that
the backlash/ image shift has become worse. The counter-clockwise
adjustment of the focus knob of 1/16th of a turn is a starting
point. If the backlash/ image shift has become worse, then turn
the focus knob clockwise again and repeat the procedure using a
counter-clockwise turn of 1/32nd of a turn, etc. Should the
focuser be too tight to turn smoothly, you can skip repeating the
procedure, and simply loosen the set screws of sides of the focus
knob and turn slightly counter-clockwise. Then retighten the set-screws
as described above.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="center">One last note about focusing your LX90. Since
there's a small amount of slop between the mirror pin and the
focuser rod hole, the mirror will tend to slip back at high
declinations and in warmer seasons. Always finish your focusing
adjustments with a counterclockwise turn on the focuser. This
&quot;pushes&quot; the primary up the OTA, and places the mirror
pin at the bottom of the focuser rod hole. When your final focus
action is in a clockwise direction, the mirror pin is left at the
top of the focuser rod, and can slip back down to the bottom of
the hole. It may not seem like a lot of movement, but it's enough
on some scopes to see a noticeable degradation of the image after
a few seconds. It's good habit to get into to focus clockwise
beyond focus, then counterclockwise to bring the image back into
focus again.</p>
