installation</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">(Using 2 Torrington
NTA-815&nbsp; 1/2&quot; thrust bearings&nbsp; and a TRA-815
thrust washer)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">1) Set the OTA so that the front (corrector
end) is slightly above level. Run the mirror all the way forward
(focuser counterclockwise) until you hit the stop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">2) Using a 5/64&quot; allen wrench,&nbsp;
remove the focuser from the OTA. Remove the three stainless
screws around the black aluminum flange. Back the focuser out of
the OTA (pulling the mirror to the rear). You may need to play
with the threaded rod a little to disengage it from the mirror
pin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">3) Once the focuser is removed from the
OTA, back off the two set screws in the focusing knob, but do not
remove them. If one comes out, put it back in a 3/4-1 turn. Grab
the brass bushing firmly and unscrew the focus knob from the
brass bushing (CCW).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">4) Clean off any excess grease from the
components. Separate the nylon washers from the brass bushing and
the focuser knob.</font></p>

</font><font size="2" face="Arial">The separated parts</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">5) Pack two bearings with a wide
temperature grease. I used an all temp conductive grease used in
photocopiers (MITA AR-2, #84032163), Excess grease from the Dec
or RA gears can also be used (red).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">6) Slide one bearing over the brass
bushing, then slide the aluminum flange over the top of the brass
bushing. This bearing will be replacing the original nylon
washer.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="focuser2.jpg" width="345" height="216" border="1"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">7) Slide the second bearing onto the brass
bushing, against the opposite side of the black flange. Make sure
the bearing rides on the brass bushing and won't slide off
center. Finish with the thrust washer over the bearing.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img src="focuser3.jpg" width="345" height="291" border="1"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">8) Reinstall two nylon washers into the
recess of the focus knob to make it flush with the thrust washer.
Use a third if the last washer doesn't make it flush. Screw the
focuser back onto the brass bushing and tighten until very
slightly snug. Tighten the two allen screws just to the point of
contact on the brass bushing. Alternate back and forth between
the two set screws very slightly tightening them the same amount
until the set screws are fairly tight. Do NOT overtighten the set
screws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">9) Check the focuser mechanics. Turn the
focus knob while holding the black flange firmly. Check that the
focuser is smooth, without any binds. Also make sure the focus
knob is centered on the brass bushing - check the runout of the
focus knob (wobble). If the focus knob is off center go back to
(8).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">10) Reinstall the focuser assembly to the
OTA. When installing the three allen screws to secure the flange
to the OTA, adjust them iteratively, like the focuser knob set
screws. Tighten them up snug, and once again do not overtighten
the screws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">11) Run the mirror back and forth to each
extreme a few times. As the grease runs through the bearings and
surfaces, you should notice that when running the focuser
clockwise, there's less drag than there is counter-clockwise.
When you notice this, the grease has evenly dispersed amoung the
parts. What you're feeling is the actual weight of the mirror
being pushed up the OTA, and the effect of gravity when pulling
it back down.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">12) The focuser should not feel stiff. If
so, back off on the focus knob (CCW) and retighten the set screws
as above. There should be no bad spots (tight or loose) for the
whole of the mirror movement. Mine feels quite nice, giving a
feeling of an accurate mechanism, but not too loose or too tight.
When turning the knob, I can just barely hear the needle bearings
turning.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Notes</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I'd suggest removing the focuser after a
month or so to check for wear on the brass and aluminum parts,
since it's been suggested that wear does occur. I'll be checking
mine if any changes are noticed in the feel of the focuser, or
after 1 month of being installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The set screws on the focuser knob now sit
on the threads of the brass bushing. This doesn't seem to be a
problem if tightened properly. This is caused by the bearings
taking up more room than the nylon washers. One LX200 user shaved
3mm off the back end of the black flange so that the set screws
would remain on the unthreaded portion.</font></p>

        There is now a commercial aftermarket production of this
        mod from </font><a href="http://www.petersonengineering.com/SkyDiv/sky_division.htm"><font face="Arial">Peterson Engineering</font></a><font face="Arial"> called the &quot;EZ-focus kit
        &#153;&quot;. It's basically the same components with a
        modified thrust washer. Although the cost is much higher,
        it will save you the trouble of finding the bearings and
        thrust washers locally. Mine were as close as the local
        bearing distributor. Total cost was about $5 US. The
        Peterson kit is around $30 US.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial">Good luck - I hope yours installs as easily
and as nicely as mine. I'm quite happy with the outcome. The only
thing I may do is replace the 2 nylon washers with a brass washer
in the future. If you have any questions, drop me an email by </font><a href="mailto:LuvJanet@aol.com?subject=Focuser Mod"><font face="Arial">clicking here</font></a><font face="Arial"> or leave
